<p>We should all feel confident in our intelligence. By the way, intelligence to me isn't just being book-smart or having a college degree; 
<br>it's trusting your gut instincts,<i><b> being intuitive, thinking outside the box,</i></b> and sometimes just realizing that things need to change and being smart enough to change it.<br></p>
